# webgl-math-lib (WIP)

WebGL数学库 - 基于[typescript-library-starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter)构建。

## Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import wml, { Vector3 } from 'webgl-math-lib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import wml, { Vector3 } from 'webgl-math-lib/dist/lib/something'
```

## NPM scripts

- `npm t`: Run test suite
- `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
- `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
- `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
- `npm run lint`: Lints code
- `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

## FAQ

### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```

### Lots of handlebars warnings with text+coverage reporter
